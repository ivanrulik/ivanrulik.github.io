<p>I am a software developer with a passion for robotics and drones. With a Master's degree in Engineering and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and creative problem-solving skills to my work.</p>

<p>With 2+ years of experience as a Research Assistant, I have worked on numerous projects and published 4 journal articles and 4 conference articles. My efforts have been recognized with numerous awards, including the UWM Chancellor's award, an NSF travel grant, an NSF-ICorps grant, and a tech challenge prize. In addition, I have filed 3 invention disclosures with the UWM Research Foundation, demonstrating my commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology.</p>

<p>In my current role, I specialize in developing projects using ROS 2, Gazebo, Mavlink, and other cutting-edge technologies. My work requires a deep understanding of programming languages such as Python, Matlab, Swift, C++, and C#, which I continue to build upon in my spare time.</p>
