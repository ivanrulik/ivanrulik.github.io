<h2 class="section-heading">Upcomming Projects</h2>

<p>On the following months I'll be covering robotics related projects based on ROS 2. The main considerations will be to develop a project from the ground up that covers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Run projects and dev environments from Docker</li>
  <li>3D design of robot models from scratch</li>
  <li>Configuration of Gazebo simulation</li>
  <li>Modeling and control of temp robot using ros control</li>
  <li>Develop API for the project</li>
  <li>Develop a web GUI to interact with the sim robot</li>
  <li>Trasnlate simulated robot into a real-life one</li>
</ol>

<p>Each one of this numerals corresponds to an individual project/goal that ultimately will result in an opne source robot</p>
